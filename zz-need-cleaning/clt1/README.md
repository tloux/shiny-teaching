As the size of a sample increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean looks more and more normal.  This app allows you to explore that by potting a histogram of the means from 1,000 samples of the size specified.  The true population density is given by the blue line, the normal distribution with the appropriate mean and standard deviation is given by the green line, and the smoothed density estimate of the sample means is given by the red line.  Notice that as the sample size increases, the red line looks less like the blue line and more like the green line.
