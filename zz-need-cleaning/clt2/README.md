This app compares the *distribution of the sample data* (top plot) to the *sampling distribution* (bottom plot).  Use the slider to choose the sample size (number of observations per sample), then enter the number of samples in the second box.  The top plot shows the data from the last of the generated samples, and the bottom plot gives a histogram of the means from all samples.  Notice that the normal curve changes with the sample size, since the standard error depends on *n*.  Click the 'Take Samples' button to repeat the process with the same values.
