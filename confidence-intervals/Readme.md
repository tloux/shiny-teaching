This app plots a histogram of sample data along with a confidence interval.  The title of the plot tells what proportion of the sample is covered by the confidence interval - notice that this propotion is much smaller than the confidence level.  This is because the confidence interval is a statement about where the **population mean** lies, not about the distribution of observed values.

All samples come from a population with mean 20.
